# Vue School - Vue Router 4 Course

Project developed as part of [Vue School's Vue Router 4 for Everyone Course](https://vueschool.io/courses/vue-router-4-for-everyone). The goal was to learn and practice how to  create Single Page Applications (SPA) with `Vue 3` and `Vue Router 4`. Also, it was an opportunity to learn how to scaffold a new `Vue 3` project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Concepts from these courses were also applied: [Vue.js 3 Fundamentals](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-3-fundamentals), [Vue.js 3 Components Fundamentals](https://vueschool.io/courses/vue-js-3-components-fundamentals) and [Reusable Vue.js Components with Slots](https://vueschool.io/courses/reusable-vuejs-components-with-slots). The topic was a travel app with some destinations and experiences for each one.
